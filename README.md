# Noter
Note taking app for Android. Made with kotlin and compose.

## Objective
Mainly to learn kotlin better. Also to have an app for note taking and TODO lists, that has everything I personally need/want.

## Preview
Some pics might come later.

## TODO
- [x] Scrollable note
- [x] Remove keyboard from blocking last items of the list
- [ ] Better coloring and font
- [x] Text note
- [ ] Update Floating button in HomeScreen

### Future plans
- Make a widget
- Make multiple note types:
    - TODO -list
    - Text note
    - Drawing note?
    - Voice note?
